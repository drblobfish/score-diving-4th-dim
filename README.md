# score-diving-4th-dim

We want to develop custom software to perform experiments to assess the advantages to the use of Virtual Reality for 4D datasets analysis (3D objects changing with time) compared to datasets diplayed on computer screen.

## Protocol

Our protocol is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nIPCcI1o5f8sB7eeenndRpnXQNSKvKGWUfrj1_Wj8oY/edit?usp=sharing).

## Files

- `unity` contains the unity project of our software for displaying datasets and recoring test subjects answers

- `dataset_generation` contains the blender and python files used to generate the datasets

## Context

This code is produced as a "SCORE" student project in the [Frontiers of Life Bachelor](https://licence.learningplanetinstitute.org/fr) (Center for Interdisciplinary Research, University of Paris) unders supervision by fellow LÃ©o Blondel.
